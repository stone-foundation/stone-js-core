The Stone.js framework is versatile, allowing you to build applications for different environments, including command line (CLI), browser, HTTP servers, cloud functions like AWS Lambda.

It offers core components such as:
- A **Service container** for managing dependencies,
- An **Event manager** to handle application events,
- A **Kernel** to execute the application lifecycle,
- An **Adapter** to ensure compatibility across different environments (e.g., console, browser, cloud), and
- A **Config Builder** to build the blueprint, which aggregates and structures configuration settings for the application.

All features are fully customizable, making it easy to extend existing functionality or integrate third-party solutions.

**Stone.js Core** is the heart of the Stone.js framework — a context-aware, universal JavaScript framework designed to help you build scalable and portable applications that adapt to any runtime.

> With Stone.js, business logic is no longer tied to one environment.  
> It becomes **reusable**, **composable**, and **context-resilient**.

Whether you're targeting a command-line interface, an HTTP server, a browser app, an AWS Lambda function, or an edge environment, `@stone-js/core` provides the foundational architecture to keep your logic consistent, modular, and fully decoupled from infrastructure.

## ✨ Why Stone.js Core?

- **Write once, run anywhere** — build your application logic independently of the environment.
- **Context-first architecture** — every runtime context (CLI, HTTP, cloud, serverless, FaaS, browser) becomes a plug-and-play adapter.
- **Universal lifecycle** — process events and produce responses in a unified flow.
- **No assumptions, full control** — fully customizable configuration, extensibility, and composition.
- **Framework without a framework** — use Stone.js with or without a frontend, backend, or transport protocol.

## 🧩 What's Inside?

Stone.js Core provides the foundational building blocks that power the entire ecosystem:

- A flexible **context execution engine** (kernel) to handle app lifecycles.
- A universal **event system** that translates any platform input into structured intents.
- A **blueprint configuration model** for organizing app behavior and dependencies.
- A powerful, context-aware **middleware and handler pipeline**.
- A runtime-independent foundation to power **modular, adaptive applications**.
